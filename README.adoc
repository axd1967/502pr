== Which one is the Photo Red?

H502pr compared to H501r

White sheet in between.

The camera cannot give back true colours, but even there the difference is striking.

== Manuals

The manuals also seem to differ:

According to the leaflet

1. strobe is accessed with triple click
1. there are _several_ strobe modes

I have the impression that I was sent

* an old unit or with the wrong LED type
* with a new leaflet

But the 4-click mode does return the battery status...
